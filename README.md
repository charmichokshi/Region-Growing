# Region-Growing
Implementation of Region Growing Algorithm on RGB Colour Image with Parallel Processing. 

RegionGrowing.py 
Input:  Colour Image (1.tif)
        Manually labelled Image (less accurately segmented) (2.tif)
Output: Precisely segmented Image (out.tif)
    
Use Function region_growing() to just implement region growing algorithm on a single coloured image.
